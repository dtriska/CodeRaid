In the heart of a war-torn land, amidst the chaos of battlefields and the clamor of conflict, there stood a soldier named EK. Unlike his comrades, who charged bravely into the thick of the fight, EK always insisted on staying ridiculously far in the back.

While his friends urged him to join them in the heat of the battle, EK remained steadfast in his resolve to keep his distance. He found solace in the safety of the shadows, where he could observe the chaos unfold from afar.

As the war raged on, EK's habit of staying far away began to take its toll. Time and time again, he watched helplessly from a distance as his friends fell in battle. Despite their pleas for his aid, he never ventured closer, unable to shake his fear of the danger that lurked in the midst of the fighting.

With each loss, EK's guilt grew heavier, but still, he could not bring himself to change his ways. He saw the potential for greatness that his friends spoke of, but he was paralyzed by his fear of the unknown.

As the war dragged on, EK became a solitary figure, haunted by the memories of those he had failed to save. He never learned to overcome his habit of staying far away, and with each passing day, the weight of his inaction grew heavier.

In the end, EK found himself alone, surrounded by the ghosts of his fallen comrades. He had never learned to fix his habit of staying far away, and in doing so, he had caused the death of all those he had acquainted or befriended.

As he stood amidst the wreckage of the war-torn land, EK realized the true cost of his fear. He had chosen safety over bravery, and in doing so, he had lost everything that mattered most. And as he gazed upon the devastation that surrounded him, he knew that some wounds could never be healed, no matter how far you tried to run from them.
